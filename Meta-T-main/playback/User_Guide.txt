Playback System User Guide


Upon loading, program will ask for a data directory. Old and new datatypes, as well as fixed-length and keyword log types are supported. Retrieves the framerate (fps) and log type (fixed_log) automatically from the configuration (.config) file, and then parses the complete log for relevant gameplay data. 


Control scheme:
    
    Episode navigation:
    [Left] 
	  Go to previous episode
    [Right]
	  Go to next episode
	*if going in the opposite direction of playback, will repeat current episode unless pressed within 1 second of start time (similar to a music player)
    
    
    Velocity control:
	[Down]
	  Reduce framerate
	[Up]
	  Increase framerate
    [Space]
      Pause or resume playback
     



    






Previous playback version (__old__positional playback.py), fully deprecated, but may guide future development of current program:



Unimplemented controls:
    [Q]
      Reverse, maintaining velocity
    Microplayback
    [<]
      Go back a single action
    [>]
      Go forward a single action
    [E]
	  Episode lock; restricts playback to current episode. Can still skip with up and down
    [T]
	  Tag lock: restricts playback to tagged episodes only



    [Relevant] Meters:
    
    Tagline (bottom):
      Indicates where in the playback of this data an event tagged as "potentially episodic" appears. 
      Above line, Translation criteria:
        Green: Most lenient
        Yellow: Medium strictness
        Red: Most strict
      Below line, Rotation criteria:
        Teal: Overrotation
        Blue: Both rotations
        Fuchia: Both Over- and Both-rotations
    *White line through tags disappears when in Taglock mode
    
    Velocity indicator (above play button):
      Indicates current velocity.
      Position and height of green bar indicate velocity, with 0 marked by the white tickmark.
      Absolute value of speed:
        Maximum: 8x
        Minimum: 1/4x
    
    Taglock indicator:
      Appears below playback controls when tags are locked. Displays tag colors
    
    Episodelock indicator:
      Appears between Play and Back button, green. Indicates when episode lock mode is active.
